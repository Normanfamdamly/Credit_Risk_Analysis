# Credit_Risk_Analysis- Challenge Module 17
---

## Overview

Financial institutions must always be concerned with credit risk if they are in the business of loaning money to clients.  So they need a way to estimate which clients are the better risk to loan funds too.  This project is designed to apply machine learning to help predict which applicants have high or low credit risk.  Allowing Lending CLub to make informed deicision on offereing credit to thier clients and hopefully limit any losses in the future due to default in payments.

### Results
---
This project will utilize 6 specific libraies from imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn models to help evaluate through resampling, oversampling, randomsampling, and undersampling of the data.  It will also include algorithms that include SMOTE, SMOTEENN and clustercentroid, along with two machine learning models that should help to minimize any bias such as balancedrandomforsedtclassifier and AdaBoost Classifer
